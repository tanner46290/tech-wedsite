  <h1>Face ID</h1>
  <p class="Paragraph">Face ID is a recent technological advancement that was created by Apple
    Inc. This new feature is used to be able to recognize the users face and
    let them do things such as unlock their phone, buy apps, and use Apple Pay.
    Touch ID was also made by Apple and is the face IDs predecessor. Face ID
    has also been used by other company such as Samsung, Google, and LG. Face
    ID did not come without controversy however. When it was released many
    people questioned how secure it was. Apple assured that it is more reliable
    and safe than touch ID however it has had some failure with distinguishing
    between identical twins. This seems to be the only slip-up and many other
    experiments have been done testing this new technology. Apple’s face ID is
    being used by millions today and seems to be enjoyed by most phone users
    around the world.</P>

  <h1>Touch ID</h1>
  <p class="Paragraph">Touch ID is the predecessor of face ID. Touch id was also created by apple
    Inc. and has also been used by other phone companies. Touch ID is not used
    as much today by Apple because the phones that they are making now don’t
    have a home button that can read your fingerprint. Apple could be bringing
    it back with their next few phones because of technology that Samsung has
    created. This technology allows the phone to read your fingerprint even
    without a home button. Touch ID was very big when it came out because before
    touch ID we had to type in passwords manually. It was the first quick way
    that could unlock your phone and was reasonably secure. Many people still
    use it and it has made the feel of their phones much smoother and easier to
    use. It was one of the greatest advancement apple has ever made to their phones.</p>

  <h1>Phone Camera</h1>
  <p class="Paragraph">Samsung was the first company to release a camera on a mobile phone. This
    was a great accomplishment because, at the time, this was unheard of. A
    camera on a smartphone was seen as a thing of the future to people back
    then. We use our smartphone camera daily and it would not be possible
    without Samsung’s advancements. This milestone gave many other phone
    companies the ability to do this as well. IPhone has used along with LG
    and Google. The first camera did not have the best quality but it was the
    first one. Since then there have been great advancements in the quality of
    the camera and the things that the camera is able to capture. The camera on
    modern day phones can now do things like record in slow motion and take a
    panorama. This first phone camera was one of the greatest advancements that
    has ever been added to a phone and millions still use it.</p>

  <img id="touchscreen" src="touchscreen.jpg" />
  <p class="Paragraph">Many credit Apple for putting the first touch screen on a phone. This is
    not true however. The first touchscreen put on a phone was made by IBM
    Simon in 1992. This phone is referred to by the first smartphone by some.
    This invention allowed other companies to put it on their phones and this
    was a very big deal. The only touchscreens that were created back then
    were on things like ATMs. This invention made normal things on your phone
    better and easier to use. Since the screen took up the whole phone it was
    much easier to watch videos and read articles. It also made it a lot
    easier to type rather than trying to type on a tiny keyboard. It also
    made the possibilities of games you could play on your phone much vaster.
    All smartphones today have a touchscreen and phones would not be the same
    without them.</p>

  <p class="Paragraph">The next milestone is the smartwatch. The smartwatch was invented by a
    man named Steve Mann in 1998. It was a Linux wristwatch. He presented it
    at IEEE ISSCC2000 in 2000. This watch was revolutionary because a watch
    like this had only been seen in movies such as Star Trek. Many people had
    dreamed of a watch like that being created. This advancement has led to
    big companies like Samsung and Apple to make their own. These smartwatches
    are very nice and can do many things. A few of the things that smartwatches
    can do it send emails, take calls, and track your heart rate. Watches like
    this have been made by fitness companies as well because these watches can
    track your steps. These watches also have the ability to be wirelessly
    charged which came relatively quickly after wireless charging was introduced
    to smartphones. These watches are very convenient and many people own one.</p>
